-  Display current model status/memory usage.
- *option to save conversatino history which would reuire databsae. 
- Clear conversation history and context when switching away.


###Better Approach: Instead of stopping Ollama entirely, you could implement:

1. Idle Detection: Stop sending requests when user is inactive
2. Resource Monitoring: Display current model status/memory usage
3. Manual Controls: Add a "Unload Model" button that sends dummy requests to force unloading
4. Session Management: Clear conversation history and context when switching away


###Recommendation:
Rather than auto-stopping Ollama (which users might not want), consider adding user controls like:

- "Pause/Resume" toggle
- "Unload Current Model" button
- Idle timeout settings
- Resource usage display

`Send an empty request to clear context`
`Switch to a tiny model temporarily`
`Make the model idle faster`
