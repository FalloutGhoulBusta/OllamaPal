### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Hamburger menu positioned on the right for better thumb accessibility
- Performance charts resize appropriately for mobile screens
- Input areas and message bubbles scale for mobile viewing
- Dropdown menus have minimum widths and appropriate padding for touch interaction

## Performance Monitoring

Real-time system performance monitoring with beautiful visualizations and accurate metrics.

### Performance Dashboard Features
- **Real-time Metrics** - Live CPU, memory, network, and system load monitoring
- **Interactive Charts** - Dynamic area charts showing performance trends over time
- **Accurate Readings** - Uses systeminformation library for precise system metrics matching Task Manager
- **Network Activity** - Displays network usage in KB/s for better granularity

1. Click the **hamburger menu** (‚ò∞) in the top-right corner
2. Select **üìä Performance Metrics** from the menu
3. View real-time system performance data and charts
4. Charts update every second with smooth animations

### Performance Metrics Displayed
- **CPU Usage** - Real-time processor utilization percentage
- **Memory Usage** - Current RAM usage vs total available memory
- **Network Activity** - Network throughput in KB/s
- **System Load** - Overall system load average

## Automatic Model Switching

The application now features intelligent model management that automatically stops previous models when switching to prevent multiple models from consuming GPU memory simultaneously.

### How It Works
- **Smart Detection** - Automatically detects when you switch models via dropdown, sidebar, or before sending messages
- **Background Cleanup** - Stops the previously running model using Ollama's API
- **Memory Optimization** - Prevents multiple models from running simultaneously, saving GPU memory
- **User Feedback** - Shows notifications during the switching process

### Model Switch Triggers
1. **Dropdown Selection** - Selecting a different model from the header dropdown
2. **Sidebar Clicks** - Clicking on a model in the sidebar model list
3. **Send Button** - Automatic detection when sending a message with a different model selected

### Visual Feedback
- **Warning Notifications** - "Switching from [old-model] to [new-model]..." (light yellow background)
- **Success Notifications** - "Successfully stopped [old-model] and switched to [new-model]" (green background)
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling with appropriate error messages if cleanup fails

### Before vs After
**Before (Multiple Models Running):**
```
PS C:\Users\user> ollama ps
NAME                ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    UNTIL
qwen2.5:0.5b        a8b0c5157701    1.3 GB    100% GPU     5 minutes from now
tinyllama:latest    2644915ede35    1.9 GB    100% GPU     3 minutes from now
```

**After (Only Current Model Running):**
```
PS C:\Users\user> ollama ps
NAME                ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    UNTIL
qwen2.5:0.5b        a8b0c5157701    1.3 GB    100% GPU     5 minutes from now
```

## Registry Testing

The application includes comprehensive model registry validation to ensure models exist before attempting to download them.

### Features
- **Manual Testing** - Test individual model names in the Pull Model modal
- **Automated Test Suite** - Run predefined tests on common models
- **Smart Validation** - Parses model names with namespace/tag support
- **Visual Feedback** - Color-coded results with detailed error messages

### How to Use
1. Open the **Pull New Model** dialog
2. Enter a model name (e.g., `llama2`, `mistral:7b`, `library/codellama:13b`)
3. Click **Test Registry** to validate the model exists
4. Or click **Run Test Suite** to test multiple predefined models
5. Review results before pulling the model

### Supported Model Formats
- `model` - Uses default 'library' namespace and 'latest' tag
- `model:tag` - Uses default 'library' namespace with specified tag
- `namespace/model:tag` - Full specification with custom namespace

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ **Success** - Model found in registry (green background)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check if Ollama is accessible: visit `http://localhost:11434` in your browser
- Configure CORS as described above
- Use the built-in Setup Assistant for guided configuration

### Automatic Model Switching Issues
- **Models not stopping** - Check browser console for API errors; ensure Ollama is running
- **Multiple models still running** - Verify `/api/ps` endpoint is accessible at `http://localhost:11434/api/ps`
- **Switch notifications not appearing** - Check if JavaScript console shows any errors
- **Debug information** - Open browser DevTools (F12) to see detailed switching logs

### Mobile Responsiveness Issues
- **Touch targets too small** - Ensure you're using the latest version with mobile optimizations
- **Sidebar not collapsing** - Check if CSS media queries are supported in your browser
- **Performance modal layout issues** - Verify screen width detection is working correctly
- **Charts not resizing** - Refresh the page or toggle the performance modal

### Performance Monitoring Issues
- **Metrics showing "--"** - Ensure the systeminformation library is properly installed
- **Charts not updating** - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Network activity showing N/A** - This is normal; network monitoring requires additional setup
- **Performance modal not opening** - Verify the hamburger menu is accessible and functional

### Animated SVG Logo Issues
- **Logo not inverting colors** - Check if CSS filter property is supported in your browser
- **Animation too fast/slow** - The 2-second interval is fixed but can be modified in the code
- **Logo not visible** - Ensure SVG content is loading properly and CSS is applied

### Registry Testing Issues
- **Model not found warnings** are normal for non-existent models
- **Network errors** may indicate connectivity issues with registry.ollama.ai
- **Parsing errors** suggest invalid model name format
- Use the Test Suite to verify registry connectivity

### Build Issues
- Make sure Node.js version is 16 or higher
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- For mobile testing, use browser developer tools to simulate mobile devices
