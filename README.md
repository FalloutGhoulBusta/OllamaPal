## Automatic Model Switching

The application now features intelligent model management that automatically stops previous models when switching to prevent multiple models from consuming GPU memory simultaneously.

### How It Works
- **Smart Detection** - Automatically detects when you switch models via dropdown, sidebar, or before sending messages
- **Background Cleanup** - Stops the previously running model using Ollama's API
- **Memory Optimization** - Prevents multiple models from running simultaneously, saving GPU memory
- **User Feedback** - Shows notifications during the switching process

### Model Switch Triggers
1. **Dropdown Selection** - Selecting a different model from the header dropdown
2. **Sidebar Clicks** - Clicking on a model in the sidebar model list
3. **Send Button** - Automatic detection when sending a message with a different model selected

### Visual Feedback
- **Warning Notifications** - "Switching from [old-model] to [new-model]..." (light yellow background)
- **Success Notifications** - "Successfully stopped [old-model] and switched to [new-model]" (green background)
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling with appropriate error messages if cleanup fails

### Before vs After
**Before (Multiple Models Running):**
```
PS C:\Users\user> ollama ps
NAME                ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    UNTIL
qwen2.5:0.5b        a8b0c5157701    1.3 GB    100% GPU     5 minutes from now
tinyllama:latest    2644915ede35    1.9 GB    100% GPU     3 minutes from now
```

**After (Only Current Model Running):**
```
PS C:\Users\user> ollama ps
NAME                ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    UNTIL
qwen2.5:0.5b        a8b0c5157701    1.3 GB    100% GPU     5 minutes from now
```

## Registry Testing

The application includes comprehensive model registry validation to ensure models exist before attempting to download them.

### Features

- Configure CORS as described above
- Use the built-in Setup Assistant for guided configuration

### Automatic Model Switching Issues
- **Models not stopping** - Check browser console for API errors; ensure Ollama is running
- **Multiple models still running** - Verify `/api/ps` endpoint is accessible at `http://localhost:11434/api/ps`
- **Switch notifications not appearing** - Check if JavaScript console shows any errors
- **Debug information** - Open browser DevTools (F12) to see detailed switching logs

- **Sidebar not collapsing** - Check if CSS media queries are supported in your browser
- **Performance modal layout issues** - Verify screen width detection is working correctly
- **Charts not resizing** - Refresh the page or toggle the performance modal

### Performance Monitoring Issues
- **Metrics showing "--"** - Ensure the systeminformation library is properly installed
- **Charts not updating** - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Network activity showing N/A** - This is normal; network monitoring requires additional setup
- **Performance modal not opening** - Verify the hamburger menu is accessible and functional

### Animated SVG Logo Issues
- **Logo not inverting colors** - Check if CSS filter property is supported in your browser
- **Animation too fast/slow** - The 2-second interval is fixed but can be modified in the code
- **Logo not visible** - Ensure SVG content is loading properly and CSS is applied

### Registry Testing Issues
- **Model not found warnings** are normal for non-existent models
- **Network errors** may indicate connectivity issues with registry.ollama.ai

- **Keyboard shortcuts help not opening** - Try using the hamburger menu ‚Üí "‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts" as alternative
- **ARIA attributes not working** - Ensure you're using a modern browser with full ARIA support
- **Focus trapped in modal** - Use Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate within modal, Escape to close

### Build Issues
- Make sure Node.js version is 16 or higher
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- For mobile testing, use browser developer tools to simulate mobile devices
- For accessibility testing, use browser developer tools accessibility panel or screen reader software
